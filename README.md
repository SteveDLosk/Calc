# Calc
A computer scientist's calculator
This repo is for a mobile app calculator for computer scientists and programmers.  
I plan on making the most common functions I need quick handy access to in the app.
Specifically, I plan on having a data type function, to determine the smallest data type you can use
based on the largest value you need to store.  I might add some descrete mathematics functions too.
